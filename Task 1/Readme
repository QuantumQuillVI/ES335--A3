Refer to the notebook on generating names using next-character prediction and modify it for generating text using next-word prediction (You have to implement MLP based text generator. However, it is recommended to refer to Andrej Karpathyâ€™s blog post on the Effectiveness of RNNs).

Visualize the embeddings using t-SNE if using more than 2 dimensions or using a scatter plot if using 2 dimensions and write your observations. Write a streamlit application that asks users for an input text, and it then predicts the next k words or lines. In the streamlit app, you should have controls for modifying context length, embedding dimension, activation function, random seed, etc. You can use any one of the datasets mentioned below.
